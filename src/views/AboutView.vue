                “Shaping”
                means we are
                actively influencing, collaborating and co-creating; ‘a sustainable future” has been defined through the
                Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). And “with the world’s leading organizations” inspires
                collaboration
                with our clients and society’s most prominent changemakers alike in order to make a difference through
                our
